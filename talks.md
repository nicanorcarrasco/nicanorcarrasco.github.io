Medvedev degrees of effective subshifts on groups. [Journ√©es annuelles SDA2](https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/9357/), Toulouse, France, 31-03-2023. 

<details><summary> Abstract üëÅ </summary>
It is known that the class of effective subshifts in $\mathbb{Z}$ can attain all $\Pi_1$ Medvedev degrees. In this talk we will discuss how this result extends to the class of finitely generated groups with decidable word problem. 
This involves codifying translation-like actions by $\mathbb{Z}$ as a subshift, and takes us to the problem of the computability of translation-like actions on locally finite graphs.</details>
